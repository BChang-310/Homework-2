In Problem 1, you will practice coding scalar, vector, and matrix operations by translating Homework 1 into Python. Next, Problem 2 will help you pracitce some graphing and visualization using Matplotlib. Don't forget, you can always develop and try out your code in Spyder before copying to this Jupyter Notebook file! \n",

    "Before we get started, let's review a bit about functions. Functions can be used in Python (or any other programming language) to quickly and efficiently rerun/reuse code without having to copy and paste it elsewhere. Using functions will help you keep your code organized, readable, and easily debuggable. Here are some key points to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, functions are declared with the keyword ```def``` which is then followed by the function name and the input arguments in parentheses. For example, in the cell below, the function ```example_function``` is declared with input arguments ```num1``` and ```num2```. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Everything you want to compute inside a function should be indented, as Python looks for indentation (specifically in increments of 4 spaces) to figure out what is inside and outside a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Any variables you want to save from a function should be placed inside a ```return``` statement at the end of the function. This is because variables declared or changed inside functions are local variables - or in other words variables inside a function can only be accessed from within the function, even if they are named the same as a variable outside the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, it is important to know that functions can only be called **after** they have been declared. For example, the following will **NOT** work because the function is called before it is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Also note how the function is declared with input arguments ```a``` and ```b``` but the variables ```first_number``` and ```second_number``` are passed when calling the function. When you call a function, you can pass in different variable names from what is declared in the function. The important thing is that the data types (number, string, list, etc.) of what is declared and what is passed match with what is computed within function. And please keep in mind that it is good practice to use variable names that are desciptive of what they represent. Abbreviations and short hand are good too if they are easily recognizable or if you comment what they mean! "
